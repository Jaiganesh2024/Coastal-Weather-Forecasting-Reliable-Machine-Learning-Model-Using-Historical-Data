# Coastal Weather Forecasting:Reliable Machine Learning Model Using Historical Data
An advanced weather prediction model for the Mangalore region was developed by an-
alyzing historical data from 2003 to 2020. Key variables include atmospheric pressure,
temperature, humidity, wind direction, and speed. Utilizing the Random Forest Regressor
algorithm, the model accurately forecasts future conditions. These localized predictions
support effective planning and decision-making for residents and authorities, enhancing
daily activities, agricultural planning, and emergency preparedness. The modelâ€™s perfor-
mance was evaluated using various metrics, ensuring its reliability and effectiveness in
real-world applications. This initiative aims to improve safety life in Mangalore region
